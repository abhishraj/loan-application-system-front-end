This is a react app and to run this first do npm run i and then npm run start

Here the first screen pops up with an option Start Application, please click on that

After that it will initiate the application by calling master data from backend for listing accounting partners

And then after filling up the form click on submit (Right now for the sake of simplicity data types validations are not there and some edge cases as well. This is just a happy flow)

After that you will see the balance sheet which can be improved further by making it in a scroll div and things like that

After that reviewing balance sheet we can just submit finally to get the decision message.

To make it non dummy!! In DecisionPage.js file please uncomment the commented line of code and remove one variable but this will work only and only if backend is also up and running.
